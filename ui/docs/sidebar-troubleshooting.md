# Sidebar Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Unresponsive Sidebar Width and Main Content

### Symptoms
1. Main content area doesn't respond to sidebar collapse state
2. Sidebar width doesn't update when --sidebar-width changes
3. Content overlaps during transitions

### Root Causes
1. Multiple layout wrappers interfering with sidebar transitions
2. Hardcoded margins overriding responsive behavior
3. Missing transition classes for width changes
4. Improper nesting of main content within SidebarInset

### Solution
1. Remove hardcoded margin classes (`ml-30`)
2. Let SidebarInset handle all spacing and transitions
3. Remove redundant main wrapper inside SidebarInset
4. Update sidebar width variables to use CSS custom properties consistently
5. Ensure proper transition classes are applied

### Implementation Notes
- SidebarInset already includes main element functionality
- Avoid nested main elements (accessibility issue)
- Use built-in responsive classes from the sidebar component
- Let the sidebar's peer variants handle spacing

## Formatting

## Docusaurus

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for our documentation. Follow the guidelines below to maintain consistency and quality:

- Use the default Docusaurus theme unless there is a specific need for customization.
- Organize the documentation into the appropriate sections as outlined above.
- Use the built-in Docusaurus components for tables of contents, sidebars, and navigation.
- Ensure that all links and references are working correctly.
- Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect the latest changes to the project.

## Review Process

- All documentation changes should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.
- Use pull requests to propose documentation changes and request reviews.
- Address any feedback or suggestions provided during the review process.
- Ensure that the documentation is clear, accurate, and complete before merging changes.
